1420 MHz Telescope
==================

This is the documentation for the Python control system for the 1420
MHz radio telescope at Acre Road observatory, Glasgow. The system is
based off the Small Radio Telescope by Haystack Observatory at MIT,
however all of the hardware and software has now been replaced, and
the system bares only a passing similarity to its ancestor.

This package contains the pythonic interface to the Arduino-based
firmware, qp, by Norman Gray, a high-level API to the telescope, a GUI
interface to the drive, and a scheduler to move the telescope
according to a pre-defined schedule.
